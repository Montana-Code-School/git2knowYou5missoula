		<p> When I was twenty, I spent a summer digging up potatoes on a farm in Ireland. I lived in a renovated horse stable with six French farm workers. My new friends insisted on cooking four-course meals every night, although they were disheartened by our limited ingredients (i.e. potatoes, lettuce, flour, cabbage, butter, salt, eggs, sometimes chicken, onions, basil, something they called “courgette”). They set the table, sat down together, and lingered over their dishes for hours. After returning home, I began to cook on my own. I bought sunflowers at the farmer's market for my table, invited friends over for spaghetti and store-bought bread. I read Michael Pollan’s <span> The Omnivore’s Dilemma </span> and found myself affected by his assertion that our unawareness of the source of food—where it comes from, how it travels to us, and its true cost—is problematic. </p> 
		<p>Shortly before graduating with a degree in Creative Writing, I joined an Environmental Studies professor and several students in launching a <a href="http://sitkasalmonshares.com/"> sustainable seafood business</a>, linking small-boat Alaskan fishermen to the landlocked town of Galesburg, Illinois, and eventually to eaters everywhere. There were no employees or customers or offices or distribution infrastructure yet and only a few fishermen involved. That first summer I was hired to package boxes of fish and deliver them, for ten hours a week. But as the company scaled rapidly, my job quickly became full-time. For the next four years, I learned more about startup businesses (and the Alaskan fishing industry!) than I ever imagined I'd want to know. </p>
		<p>Since moving west in 2015, I've been involved in a number of other small but scaling food and farming projects, mostly as a volunteer or copywriter. I'm keenly interested in how the ways we connect with what we eat can influence the ways we connect with one another and our planet. I'm convinced technology will play an increasingly vital role in shaping these relationships. I'm excited to learn more about how new software could influence the local and organic food movement, and community-driven startups in general. Ultimately, I see learning code as a way to continue working within these contexts in new ways, work that I find both creative and meaningful.  </p>
