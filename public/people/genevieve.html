		<p>When I was twenty, I spent a summer digging up potatoes on a farm in Ireland. I lived in a renovated horse stable with six French farm workers. My new friends insisted on cooking four-course meals every night, although they were disheartened by our limited ingredients (i.e. potatoes, lettuce, flour, cabbage, butter, salt, eggs, sometimes chicken, onions, basil, something they called “courgette”). They set the table, sat down together, and lingered over their dishes for hours. After returning home, I began to cook on my own. I bought sunflowers at the farmer's market for my table, invited friends over for spaghetti and store-bought bread. I read Michael Pollan’s <span> The Omnivore’s Dilemma </span> and found myself affected by his assertion that our unawareness of the source of food—where it comes from, how it travels to us, and its true cost—is problematic. </p> 
		<p>Shortly before graduating, I joined an Environmental Studies professor and several students in launching a <a href="http://sitkasalmonshares.com/"> sustainable seafood business</a>, linking small-boat Alaskan fishermen to the landlocked town of Galesburg, Illinois, and eventually to eaters everywhere. There were no employees or customers or offices or distribution infrastructure yet and only a few fishermen involved. That first summer I was hired to package boxes of fish and deliver them, for ten hours a week. But as the company scaled rapidly, my job quickly became full-time. For the next four years, I learned more about startup businesses (and the Alaskan fishing industry!) than I ever imagined I'd want to know. And seeing the intensely collaborative project through from academic experiment to "real" business transformed me too. </p>
		<p>I'm still keenly interested in how the ways we connect with what we eat can influence the ways we connect with one another and our planet. I'm convinced technology will play an increasingly vital role in shaping these relationships in the future. In a related vein, I'm interested in how software facilitates connections between individuals who likely wouldn't ever sit down at the table together in a pre-internet era. I'm thinking of social networks, dating services, and exchange-based communities such as WWOOF and Couchsurfing. And so, I'm excited to learn more about software potential and innovation in community-driven business models. Ultimately, I see learning code as a way to continue working with community-driven startups, and within the good food movement specifically. It's work I find creatively engaging and incredibly meaningful.  </p>
