    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>I moved to Missoula a little over a year ago from Wisconsin with my girl friend Jessica.</li>
            <li>When I got to Missoula I started a career in Insurance. While it is a good career, and I learned alot about retirement planning it was not for me.</li>
            <li>I am fasinated by how programs work. I joined <a href="https://montanacodeschool.com/">Montana Code School</a> to learn as much as I can and hopefully start a career in the field after.</li>
            <li>I have two dogs there  names are Nala and Winston. I will let you know now, I am obsessed</li>
            <li>They are both rescues and both mutts, Winston is a Corgie-Pitbull mix, and Nala is a German Shepard-Rhodestian Ridgeback mix</li>
