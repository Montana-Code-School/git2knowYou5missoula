			<H2>Bio</H2>
				<p>I am a native third generation Montanan, I grew up in Whitefish, and fell in love with Missoula when I moved here for school in 1996.</p>
			<H2>Why am I here?</H2>
				<p>I started dabbling in HTML as a high schooler and have freelanced as a side job ever since, but am completely self taught.  Now, I want to take the plunge into web development as a career.</p>
