			<H2>Bio</H2>
				<p class="indent">I am a native third generation Montanan, I grew up in Whitefish, and fell in love with Missoula when I moved here for school in 1996.  I've been here ever since.  I am newly married with 3 teenaged step-kids and a myriad of pets.  I left my job as an online freight consultant to follow my hobby of teaching myself web design and hopefully turn it into a more serious career.</p>
			<H2>Why am I here in the Code School?</H2>
				<p class="indent">I started dabbling in HTML as a high schooler and have freelanced as a side job ever since, but am completely self taught.  I want to take the plunge into web development as a career and feel like this is a good place to strengthen my skills and help me move beyond just HTML and CSS.</p>
