	<p>Why waste more money on higher education when you can learn applicable knowledge that will actually help you in life?  Beats me. I hope to learn and understand the foundational elements that will allow me to communicate within and/or between various tech companies. Montana's high tech sector is salivating over us at the Montana Code School.

	<h2> Little bit about me:</h2>

	<p> I'm a psychology major looking for a new path that doesn't lead to $11/hr after four years of higher education. 
	I have a mini Aussie named Romeo.  He's a lady killer.
	Curb Your Enthusiasm is prettay, prettay, prettay good. </p>
