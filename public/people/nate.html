	<div><h1>Nate Christianson's Blurbage</h1>  
	
	<p>I was born and raised in Montana all my life.  Went to the University of Montana for four years and received my bachelors degree.  Once I finally accepted the realization that a bachelors degree in Psychology doesn't have much potential in the job market, I found myself needing to find something to do.  With raving reviews about MTCS, I made the leap towards the code school.  I hope to learn and understand the foundational elements that will allow me to communicate within and/or between various tech companies.  I've been immersed in the startup/entrepreneurial tech community for two years, and think programming knowledge would be very beneficial in pursuing a career related to the high tech sector.  Montana's high tech sector is salivating over us at the Montana Code School.

	<h2> More about this guy</h2>

	<p> I'm a psychology major looking for a new path that doesn't lead to $11/hr after four years of higher education. 
	I do typical Montana resident things - Hiking, fishing, taking care of my dog child.  
	I have a mini Aussie named Romeo.  He's a lady killer.
