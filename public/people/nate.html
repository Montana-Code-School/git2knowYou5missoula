	This is Nate's personal page. 

	I'm a psychology major turned program developer wanna-be looking for a new path that doesn't pay lead to $11/hr.  Why waste more money on education when you can learn applicable knowledge that will actually help you in life?  Beats me. I hope to learn and understand the foundational elements that will allow me to communicate within and/or between various tech companies. I have a mini Aussie named Romeo.  He's a lady killer.  That's about it.
