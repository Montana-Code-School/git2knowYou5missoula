<p class="p1">Hello, my name is Quinneisha. I am a 23 year old female and I am completely new to coding. I am the oldest of 6 children and I moved to Montana one month ago. The reason I enrolled in the Montana Code School program is because I researched and found that there was a want for more women coders. I want to learn as much as I can and be able to be great at web development.</p>
