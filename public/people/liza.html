			  <h3>What got me to MTCS?</h3>
			  <p class="codeSchool">Two years ago I started developing the social media platform <a href="http://www.huntthewildwest.com" target="_blank">Hunt the Wild West</a> with my business partner. All of my programming knowledge to this point was self taught. After working with a developer on HTWW and pursuing a position as a web developer at EDGE Marketing and Design I felt a desire to further my knowledge in the field of software engineering.</p>

			  <h3>A Little Bit About Me</h3>

			  <p class="codeSchool"> I am a third generation Montana born and raised outdoors. I love hunting, hiking, fishing, and photographing anything wild. I am pursuing multimedia production and web development so I can continue to live here. </p>
